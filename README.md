An app for iOS and Android to find out when your bus, Circulator, or train is coming to a stop near you, using WMATA and NextBus prediction data.

Built using:

* Cordova/PhoneGap
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* jQuery/jQuery UI/jQuery Mobile
* Underscore.js
* jQuery UI Touch Punch
* FastClick
* iScroll and jQuery Mobile iScrollView
* ZSPinAnnotation

Please feel free to download, fork, or help this app improve. You'll need to add your own WMATA api key to config.js in the /www/js/ directory to compile a working version. (Get a free key at http://developer.wmata.com/)
